    <h2 class="center">Postmortem</h2>

    <div class="center" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; padding: 20px;">
        <p>
            Looking back on our development process, there are several areas of our engine and game that we would have expanded if we had more time.
        </p>

        <h3>Core Systems & Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>
            One of our main goals would have been to build a more robust level progression system with multiple stages, unlockable content, and meaningful difficulty scaling. This would have given players a clearer sense of advancement as they moved through the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also hoped to implement a full audio system. Background music, sound effects for actions, and clearer audio cues would have made the game more immersive and helped players better understand in-game events.
        </p>
        <p>
            A proper save/load system using serialization and deserialization was another feature we wanted to include. This would have enabled players to preserve their progress between sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, we wanted to provide a settings menu for custom keybinds so players could tailor controls to their preferences.
        </p>

        <h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
        <p>
            On the gameplay side, we would add monster–plant interactions, allowing enemies to actively attack and damage crops.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another idea was a seed packet system with limited quantities that spawn randomly during gameplay. We also could implement a full shop mechanic for purchasing seeds and other supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we wanted to build an inventory management system for tools to make gameplay more strategic and organized.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Learned</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout development, we gained experience with a number of core game-dev concepts. While implementing the tile editor, we learned how to build a functional GUI in PyQt and how to create an autotiling system. Understanding delta time was another important lesson. It allowed us to ensure consistent gameplay speed across hardware variations. We also learned how to handle diagonal movement properly by normalizing velocity so players don't move faster diagonally than they do vertically or horizontally. Lastly, implementing a flexible input management system using the command pattern gave us valuable experience in decoupling input from game logic.
